# ChatGPT-API

## Introduction
Recently ChatGPT shake internet with its amazing results. This repository is a simple API for ChatGPT, where you can query many questions and get answers from ChatGPT. I created this repository to make it easier for people who wants to see the ChatGPT response for their many questions. 


## Features
- Query many questions and get answers from ChatGPT
- Save the questions and answers in a file ie. `qna.txt`


## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- requests and json libraries
- OpenAI API key


## How to get OpenAI API key
Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and sign up for an account. You can create an API key by clicking on the `Create new secret key` button. Copy the API key and paste it in the `chatgpt.py` file. Note that the API key is a secret key, so don't share it with anyone and once created you can't see the same key again. So, make sure you copy the key and paste it in the `chatgpt.py` file.


## Before you start
Enter your questions in the `questions.txt` file. Each question should be in a new line. Every question should end within a line. For example, if you want to ask two questions, then your `questions.txt` file should look like this:
